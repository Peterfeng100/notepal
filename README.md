# notepal
notepal is an automated note taking assistant that uses both computer vision as well as Speech-To-Text NLP to generate nicely typed LaTex documents. We made a built-in file management system and everything syncs with the cloud upon command. We hope to provide users with a smooth, integrated experience that lasts from the moment they start notepal to the moment they see their notes on the cloud.
